# WEP Attack Simulator

## Overview
The WEP Attack Simulator is a Java program designed to demonstrate the vulnerability in WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption through a simulated attack. By generating and comparing XOR combinations of provided message and ciphertext spaces, it highlights potential security weaknesses in the WEP protocol (When the same key is used twice.)

## Features
- Generates all possible XOR pairs from given message and ciphertext spaces.
- Identifies matching XOR pairs to simulate an attack scenario.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Java codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Installation
You can clone it directly. On your local machine, you need to replace the sample Bit--Strings with your actual values.
